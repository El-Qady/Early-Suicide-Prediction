## 📌 Description  
A data-driven project aimed at predicting the likelihood of whether an individual has **thought about or attempted suicide**.  
The primary goal is to **support early detection** and **reduce associated risks** by leveraging **machine learning models** and **interactive visualizations**.  

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing  
- Cleaned data from **missing values** and **outliers**.  
- Encoded categorical variables for modeling.  
- Scaled numerical features to ensure consistency.  
- Applied **Oversampling** to handle class imbalance and improve model learning.  

### 2️⃣ Data Splitting  
- Divided the dataset into **Training** and **Testing** sets to evaluate model performance effectively.  

### 3️⃣ Modeling  
- Built and compared three models:  
  - **Neural Network** 🧠  
  - **Decision Tree** 🌳  
  - **Random Forest** 🌲  
- Used **Grid Search** for hyperparameter tuning to select the best parameters and improve accuracy.  

### 4️⃣ Data Visualization  
- Designed an **Interactive Power BI Dashboard** to display results and insights in a clear, visual format.

## 📊 Key Insights from the Dashboard  

- 👥 **Number of patients:** 1,099 total, with 208 self-harm cases (**suicide rate = 13.74%**).  
- 😔 **Depression link:** Individuals with **constant depression** had the highest attempt rates.  
- 🎓 **Academic performance:** Students with **good grades were still at risk**, not only those with poor performance.  
- 👶 **Age group at risk:** Young adults aged **20–25 recorded the highest attempt rates**.  
- 💔 **Relationship status:** Individuals who experienced **breakups** showed higher attempt rates than singles or those in relationships.  
- 🫂 **Mental support:** People supported by **friends** outnumbered those supported by family — raising questions about the **type and quality of support**.  
- 🏠 **Family issues impact:** **Parental conflicts** had a stronger influence on suicidal behavior compared to financial problems.
